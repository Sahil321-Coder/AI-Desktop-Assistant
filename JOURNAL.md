# May 25th: Designed The 3D Model in FreeCAD!

I started by taking measurements of Arduino and other parts I am going to use, and designed it so that all these would fit inside the 3D Model, and successfully made the 3D Model.

**Total time spent: 3.2h**

# May 26th: Made the BOM File and the Wiring Diagram!

So I have made this Circuit Diagram in WOKWI, and you can also see the BOM File in CSV Format on the Main page, I have listed all the the materials I have used in that file.
( Instead of Arduino MKR Zero I am using ESP32 Note it )

# May 27th: Programmed the ESP32 Code and compiled!

I have successfully programmed the Arduino code and now it has features like taking real time weather in Nashik ( Where I live), It will take weatehr from the API Key of Openweather, and also plays music , I  have just put 1 Music inside it, so it will play only one. This is the Wokwi Simulation Link "https://wokwi.com/projects/432008413019172865"



**Total time spent: 4h**

# May 28th: Programmed the Python Code, compiled & Debugged !!

I have programmed the python ocde in PyCharm Community Edition and Debugged it !!
So, the resources for my Projects are ready and tomorrow i will be finally Debugging them & testing them online !!!1
