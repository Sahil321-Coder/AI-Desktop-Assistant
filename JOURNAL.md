1. [Day 1](#day1)  
   *25-05-2025*
   * I have started taking Measurements of the components I will be using in the project, and side-by-side, I was making the 3D Model based on those measurements. I was a beginner to all that 3D Modelling
     So I think it is hard to do it

   * I have successfully made the 3D Model in Blender 4.4, but I had some difficulties making it,  taking the size of the Arduino, Breadboard, 0.96 Inch Display and then making that sure that they all
     will fit inside the 3D Model
   * * Time Spent - 2.3 hours *
