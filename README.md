Arduino AI Desktop Assistant

My Arduino AI Desktop Assistant is designed to enhance  user experience through voice commands and automation. This project integrates Arduino with machine learning to create an intelligent assistant to perform various tasks.

Note: That the python code should be runed in the PyCharm Community Edition fot better and smooth results.

Features :

1. Voice Recognition: It uses our built-in laptop or Desktop Mic to listen to what we say, and gives us an answer using the API Key I used ( OpenRouter ),  and it also displays the answer, but in a short version
on the OLED Display, and also  note that I am using PyCharm Community Edition, so use that only for a better experience and to work it smoothly.

2. Real Time Weather: It shows the real-time weather of the Place where I live ( Nashik ), you can change it by changing the latitude & longitude of the place where you live. I am using Weather Stack API Key
for this project.

3. Plays Music: I just put 1 music in the Code, you can put more by changing this " ![Screenshot 2025-05-28 124243](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/844e735f-96ab-49e1-b308-fabf7dba2476) and this also

 " in the python code, it is given in the Important Files > Program Files > Python code ( Note: This will be a folder, open the folder, and take all the files you want, use PyCharm for better performance and smooth work, if you are using different environment(I don't know it will work or not)for more instructions refer to Instructions folder in Important Files > Instructions_for_python.txt )


For the materials I used, I have given a BOM File in CSV Format, you can check it.
