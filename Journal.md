> ⚠️ **The following instructions are CRITICAL!**  
> 
> **Note:** Outline potential avenues for future research and improvements to your model. Each suggestion should be practical and relevant to the field.

- **Model Improvements**: Discuss potential enhancements to the model based on findings from your research.
- **Expanding Datasets**: Suggest gathering more diverse datasets to improve model robustness.
- **Longitudinal Studies**: Propose conducting longitudinal studies to assess the long-term efficacy of the model.

**Example:**

Future research could focus on several avenues to enhance the performance and applicability of our model. Firstly, expanding the dataset to include a more diverse population could improve the model's generalizability across different demographic groups. Additionally, incorporating longitudinal data could help in understanding the model's predictive power over time and its effectiveness in monitoring treatment responses. There is also potential for integrating the model into mobile health applications, allowing for real-time eczema assessment and tracking. Finally, further investigation into the ethical implications and biases inherent in the training data is necessary to ensure that the model promotes equitable healthcare access and outcomes for all patients. By addressing these areas, we can significantly advance the utility of our model in real-world clinical settings.
